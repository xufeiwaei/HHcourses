AVRDUDE - AVR Downloader Uploader - is a program for downloading and
uploading the on-chip memories of Atmel's AVR microcontrollers. It can
program the Flash and EEPROM, and where supported by the serial
programming protocol, it can program fuse and lock bits. AVRDUDE also
supplies a direct instruction mode allowing one to issue any programming
instruction to the AVR chip regardless of whether AVRDUDE implements
that specific feature of a particular chip.

   <p>AVRDUDE can be used effectively via the command line to read or write
all chip memory types (eeprom, flash, fuse bits, lock bits, signature
bytes) or via an interactive (terminal) mode. Using AVRDUDE from the
command line works well for programming the entire memory of the chip
from the contents of a file, while interactive mode is useful for
exploring memory contents, modifing individual bytes of eeprom,
programming fuse/lock bits, etc.

   <p>AVRDUDE supports the following basic programmer types: Atmel's STK500,
Atmel's AVRISP and AVRISP mkII devices,
Atmel's STK600,
Atmel's JTAG ICE (both mkI and mkII, the latter also in ISP mode), appnote
avr910, appnote avr109 (including the AVR Butterfly),
serial bit-bang adapters,
and the PPI (parallel port interface). PPI represents a class
of simple programmers where the programming lines are directly
connected to the PC parallel port. Several pin configurations exist
for several variations of the PPI programmers, and AVRDUDE can be be
configured to work with them by either specifying the appropriate
programmer on the command line or by creating a new entry in its
configuration file. All that's usually required for a new entry is to
tell AVRDUDE which pins to use for each programming function.

   <p>A number of equally simple bit-bang programming adapters that connect
to a serial port are supported as well, among them the popular
Ponyprog serial adapter, and the DASA and DASA3 adapters that used to
be supported by uisp(1).  Note that these adapters are meant to be
attached to a physical serial port.  Connecting to a serial port
emulated on top of USB is likely to not work at all, or to work
abysmally slow.

   <p>The STK500, JTAG ICE, avr910, and avr109/butterfly use the serial port to communicate with the PC. 
The STK600, JTAG ICE mkII, AVRISP mkII, USBasp, and USBtinyISP
programmers communicate through the USB, using <code>libusb</code> as a
platform abstraction layer. 
The STK500, STK600, JTAG ICE, and avr910 contain on-board logic to control the programming of the target
device. 
The avr109 bootloader implements a protocol similar to avr910, but is
actually implemented in the boot area of the target's flash ROM, as
opposed to being an external device. 
The fundamental difference between the two types lies in the
protocol used to control the programmer. The avr910 protocol is very
simplistic and can easily be used as the basis for a simple, home made
programer since the firmware is available online. On the other hand,
the STK500 protocol is more robust and complicated and the firmware is
not openly available. 
The JTAG ICE also uses a serial communication protocol which is similar
to the STK500 firmware version 2 one.  However, as the JTAG ICE is
intented to allow on-chip debugging as well as memory programming, the
protocol is more sophisticated. 
(The JTAG ICE mkII protocol can also be run on top of USB.) 
Only the memory programming functionality of the JTAG ICE is supported
by AVRDUDE. 
For the JTAG ICE mkII, JTAG, debugWire and ISP mode are supported. 
See below for the limitations of debugWire.

   <p>The Arduino (which is very similar to the STK500 1.x) is supported via
its own programmer type specification &ldquo;arduino&rdquo;.

   <p>The AVR Dragon is supported in all modes (ISP, JTAG, HVSP, PP, debugWire). 
When used in JTAG and debugWire mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to a
JTAG ICE mkII, so all device-specific comments for that device
will apply as well. 
When used in ISP mode, the AVR Dragon behaves similar to an
AVRISP mkII (or JTAG ICE mkII in ISP mode), so all device-specific
comments will apply there. 
In particular, the Dragon starts out with a rather fast ISP clock
frequency, so the <code>-B </code><var>bitclock</var>
option might be required to achieve a stable ISP communication.

   <p>The USBasp ISP and USBtinyISP adapters are also supported, provided AVRDUDE
has been compiled with libusb support. 
They both feature simple firwmare-only USB implementations, running on
an ATmega8 (or ATmega88), or ATtiny2313, respectively.
