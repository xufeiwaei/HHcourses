<h3 class="section">D.10 Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode</h3>

<p><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s remote protocol supports non-stop debugging of
multi-threaded programs, as described in <a href="Non_002dStop-Mode.html#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>.  If the stub
supports non-stop mode, it should report that to <span class="sc">gdb</span> by including
`<samp><span class="samp">QNonStop+</span></samp>' in its `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>' response (see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> typically sends a `<samp><span class="samp">QNonStop</span></samp>' packet only when
establishing a new connection with the stub.  Entering non-stop mode
does not alter the state of any currently-running threads, but targets
must stop all threads in any already-attached processes when entering
all-stop mode.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses the `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' packet as necessary to
probe the target state after a mode change.

   <p>In non-stop mode, when an attached process encounters an event that
would otherwise be reported with a stop reply, it uses the
asynchronous notification mechanism (see <a href="Notification-Packets.html#Notification-Packets">Notification Packets</a>) to
inform <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  In contrast to all-stop mode, where all threads
in all processes are stopped when a stop reply is sent, in non-stop
mode only the thread reporting the stop event is stopped.  That is,
when reporting a `<samp><span class="samp">S</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>' response to indicate completion
of a step operation, hitting a breakpoint, or a fault, only the
affected thread is stopped; any other still-running threads continue
to run.  When reporting a `<samp><span class="samp">W</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">X</span></samp>' response, all running
threads belonging to other attached processes continue to run.

   <p>Only one stop reply notification at a time may be pending; if
additional stop events occur before <span class="sc">gdb</span> has acknowledged the
previous notification, they must be queued by the stub for later
synchronous transmission in response to `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>' packets from
<span class="sc">gdb</span>.  Because the notification mechanism is unreliable,
the stub is permitted to resend a stop reply notification
if it believes <span class="sc">gdb</span> may not have received it.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
ignores additional stop reply notifications received before it has
finished processing a previous notification and the stub has completed
sending any queued stop events.

   <p>Otherwise, <span class="sc">gdb</span> must be prepared to receive a stop reply
notification at any time.  Specifically, they may appear when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is not otherwise reading input from the stub, or when
<span class="sc">gdb</span> is expecting to read a normal synchronous response or a
`<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'/`<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' acknowledgment to a packet it has sent. 
Notification packets are distinct from any other communication from
the stub so there is no ambiguity.

   <p>After receiving a stop reply notification, <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall
acknowledge it by sending a `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>' packet (see <a href="vStopped-packet.html#vStopped-packet">vStopped packet</a>)
as a regular, synchronous request to the stub.  Such acknowledgment
is not required to happen immediately, as <span class="sc">gdb</span> is permitted to
send other, unrelated packets to the stub first, which the stub should
process normally.

   <p>Upon receiving a `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>' packet, if the stub has other queued
stop events to report to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, it shall respond by sending a
normal stop reply response.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall then send another
`<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>' packet to solicit further responses; again, it is
permitted to send other, unrelated packets as well which the stub
should process normally.

   <p>If the stub receives a `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>' packet and there are no
additional stop events to report, the stub shall return an `<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>'
response.  At this point, if further stop events occur, the stub shall
send a new stop reply notification, <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall accept the
notification, and the process shall be repeated.

   <p>In non-stop mode, the target shall respond to the `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' packet as
follows.  First, any incomplete stop reply notification/`<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>'
sequence in progress is abandoned.  The target must begin a new
sequence reporting stop events for all stopped threads, whether or not
it has previously reported those events to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  The first
stop reply is sent as a synchronous reply to the `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' packet, and
subsequent stop replies are sent as responses to `<samp><span class="samp">vStopped</span></samp>' packets
using the mechanism described above.  The target must not send
asynchronous stop reply notifications until the sequence is complete. 
If all threads are running when the target receives the `<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>' packet,
or if the target is not attached to any process, it shall respond
`<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>'.
