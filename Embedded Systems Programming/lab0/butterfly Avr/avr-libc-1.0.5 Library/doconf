# This script will execute configure in the build directory. It will
# erase the build directories if they exist already.
# The main build directory is created. The multilib build directories
# are created by the main configure.
# It will first set the path to the path, where the cross compiler
# can be found. If your cross compiler is in an other directory,
# please change the "PREFIX:" line below or specify it at the command line
# ("PREFIX=what_you_want doconf").
# If you have the path to the cross compiler in you default path, erase
# the "PATH=" line below.
#
# It is very important that you check the installation path. It has to
# be the same as for the avr gcc.
