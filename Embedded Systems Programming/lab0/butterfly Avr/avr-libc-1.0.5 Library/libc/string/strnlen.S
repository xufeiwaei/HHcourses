/** \ingroup avr_string
    \fn size_t strnlen(const char *src, size_t len)
    \brief Determine the length of a fixed-size string.

    The strnlen function returns the number of characters in the string
    pointed to by src, not including the terminating '\\0' character, but at
    most len. In doing this, strnlen looks only at the first len characters at
    src and never beyond src+len.

    \returns The strnlen function returns strlen(src), if that is less than
    len, or len if there is no '\\0' character among the first len
    characters pointed to by src. */
