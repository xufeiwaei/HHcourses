/** \ingroup avr_string
    \fn int strncasecmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t len)
    \brief Compare two strings ignoring case.

    The strncasecmp() function is similar to strcasecmp(), except it only
    compares the first n characters of s1.

    \returns The strncasecmp() function returns an integer less than, equal to,
    or greater than zero if s1 (or the first n bytes thereof) is found,
    respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.  */
