/** \ingroup avr_string
    \fn char *strtok_r(char *string, const char *delim, char **last)
    \brief Parses the string s into tokens.

    strtok_r parses the string s into tokens. The first call to strtok_r
    should have string as its first argument. Subsequent calls should have
    the first argument set to NULL. If a token ends with a delimiter, this
    delimiting character is overwritten with a '\\0' and a pointer to the next
    character is saved for the next call to strtok_r. The delimiter string
    delim may be different for each call. last is a user allocated char*
    pointer. It must be the same while parsing the same string. strtok_r is
    a reentrant version of strtok().
    
    \returns The strtok_r() function returns a pointer to the next token or
    NULL when no more tokens are found. */
