/** \defgroup avr_eeprom EEPROM handling
    \code #include <avr/eeprom.h> \endcode

    This header file declares the interface to some simple library
    routines suitable for handling the data EEPROM contained in the
    AVR microcontrollers.  The implementation uses a simple polled
    mode interface.  Applications that require interrupt-controlled
    EEPROM access to ensure that no time will be wasted in spinloops
    will have to deploy their own implementation.

    \note All of the read/write functions first make sure the EEPROM
     is ready to be accessed.  Since this may cause long delays if a
     write operation is still pending, time-critical applications
     should first poll the EEPROM e. g. using eeprom_is_ready() before
     attempting any actual I/O.

    \note This library will \e not work with the ATmega169 since this
    device has the EEPROM IO ports at different locations!
