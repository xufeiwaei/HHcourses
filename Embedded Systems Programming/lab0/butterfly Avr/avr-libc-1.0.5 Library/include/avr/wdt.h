    This header file declares the interface to some inline macros
    handling the watchdog timer present in many AVR devices.  In order
    to prevent the watchdog timer configuration from being
    accidentally altered by a crashing application, a special timed
    sequence is required in order to change it.  The macros within
    this header file handle the required sequence automatically
    before changing any value.  Interrupts will be disabled during
    the manipulation.

    \note Depending on the fuse configuration of the particular
    device, further restrictions might apply, in particular it might
    be disallowed to turn off the watchdog timer. */

/**
   \ingroup avr_watchdog
   Symbolic constants for the watchdog timeout.  Since the watchdog
   timer is based on a free-running RC oscillator, the times are
   approximate only and apply to a supply voltage of 5 V.  At lower
   supply voltages, the times will increase.  For older devices, the
   times will be as large as three times when operating at Vcc = 3 V,
   while the newer devices (e. g. ATmega128, ATmega8) only experience
   a negligible change.

   Possible timeout values are: 15 ms, 30 ms, 60 ms, 120 ms, 250 ms,
   500 ms, 1 s, 2 s.  Symbolic constants are formed by the prefix
   \c WDTO_, followed by the time.

   Example that would select a watchdog timer expiry of approximately
   500 ms:
   \code
   wdt_enable(WDTO_500MS);
