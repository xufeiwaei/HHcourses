/** \page install_tools Installing the GNU Tool Chain

\addindex installation

\note This discussion was taken directly from Rich Neswold's document. (See
\ref acks).

\note This discussion is Unix specific. [FIXME: troth/2002-08-13: we need a
volunteer to add windows specific notes to these instructions.]

This chapter shows how to build and install a complete development environment
for the AVR processors using the GNU toolset.

The default behaviour for most of these tools is to install every thing under
the \c /usr/local directory.  In order to keep the AVR tools separate from the
base system, it is usually better to install everything into
<tt>/usr/local/avr</tt>.  If the \c /usr/local/avr directory does not exist,
you should create it before trying to install anything.  You will need
<tt>root</tt> access to install there.  If you don't have root access to the
system, you can alternatively install in your home directory, for example, in
<tt>$HOME/local/avr</tt>.  Where you install is a completely arbitrary
decision, but should be consistent for all the tools.

You specify the installation directory by using the <tt>--prefix=dir</tt>
option with the \c configure script.  It is important to install all the AVR
tools in the same directory or some of the tools will not work correctly.  To
ensure consistency and simplify the discussion, we will use \c $PREFIX to
refer to whatever directory you wish to install in.  You can set this as an
environment variable if you wish as such (using a Bourne-like shell):

\addindex $PREFIX
\addindex --prefix
\verbatim
$ PREFIX=$HOME/local/avr
$ export PREFIX
\endverbatim

\addindex $PATH
\anchor path \note Be sure that you have your \c PATH environment variable set
to search the directory you install everything in \e before you start
installing anything.  For example, if you use <tt>--prefix=$PREFIX</tt>, you
must have \c $PREFIX/bin in your exported <tt>PATH</tt>. As such:

\verbatim
$ PATH=$PATH:$PREFIX/bin
$ export PATH
\endverbatim

\warning If you have \c CC set to anything other than \c avr-gcc in your
environment, this will cause the configure script to fail. It is best to not
have \c CC set at all.

\note The versions for the packages listed below are known to work together.
If you mix and match different versions, you may have problems.

\section install_avr_binutils GNU Binutils for the AVR target
\addindex installation, binutils

The <tt><b>binutils</b></tt> package provides all the low-level utilities
needed in building and manipulating object files.  Once installed, your
environment will have an AVR assembler (<tt>avr-as</tt>), linker
(<tt>avr-ld</tt>), and librarian (<tt>avr-ar</tt> and <tt>avr-ranlib</tt>).
In addition, you get tools which extract data from object files
(<tt>avr-objcopy</tt>), dissassemble object file information
(<tt>avr-objdump</tt>), and strip information from object files
(<tt>avr-strip</tt>).  Before we can build the C compiler, these tools need to
be in place.

Download and unpack the source files:

\verbatim
$ bunzip2 -c binutils-<version>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ cd binutils-<version>
\endverbatim

\note Replace \c <version> with the version of the package you downloaded.

\note If you obtained a gzip compressed file (.gz), use <tt>gunzip</tt>
instead of <tt>bunzip2</tt>.

It is usually a good idea to configure and build <tt><b>binutils</b></tt> in a
subdirectory so as not to pollute the source with the compiled files.  This is
recommended by the <tt><b>binutils</b></tt> developers.

\verbatim
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
\endverbatim

The next step is to configure and build the tools. This is done by supplying
arguments to the <tt>configure</tt> script that enable the AVR-specific
options.

\verbatim
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX --target=avr --disable-nls
\endverbatim

If you don't specify the <tt>--prefix</tt> option, the tools will get
installed in the \c /usr/local hierarchy (i.e. the binaries will get installed
in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>, the info pages get installed in
<tt>/usr/local/info</tt>, etc.) Since these tools are changing frequently, It
is preferrable to put them in a location that is easily removed.

When <tt>configure</tt> is run, it generates a lot of messages while it
determines what is available on your operating system. When it finishes, it
will have created several <tt>Makefile</tt>s that are custom tailored to your
platform. At this point, you can build the project.

\verbatim
$ make
\endverbatim

\note BSD users should note that the project's <tt>Makefile</tt> uses GNU
<tt>make</tt> syntax. This means FreeBSD users may need to build the tools by
using <tt>gmake</tt>.

If the tools compiled cleanly, you're ready to install them. If you specified
a destination that isn't owned by your account, you'll need <tt>root</tt>
access to install them. To install:

\verbatim
$ make install
\endverbatim

You should now have the programs from binutils installed into
<tt>$PREFIX/bin</tt>.  Don't forget to \ref path "set your PATH" environment
variable before going to build avr-gcc.

\section install_avr_gcc GCC for the AVR target
\addindex installation, gcc

\warning You <em><b>must</b></em> install 
\ref install_avr_binutils "avr-binutils" and make sure your 
\ref path "path is set" properly before installing avr-gcc.

The steps to build \c avr-gcc are essentially same as for 
\ref install_avr_binutils "binutils":

\verbatim
$ bunzip2 -c gcc-<version>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ cd gcc-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX --target=avr --enable-languages=c,c++ \
    --disable-nls
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

To save your self some download time, you can alternatively download only the
<tt>gcc-core-<version>.tar.bz2</tt> and <tt>gcc-c++-<version>.tar.bz2</tt>
parts of the gcc.  Also, if you don't need C++ support, you only need the core
part and should only enable the C language support.

\note Early versions of these tools did not support C++.

\note The stdc++ libs are not included with C++ for AVR due to the size
limitations of the devices.

\section install_avr_libc AVR Libc
\addindex installation, avr-libc

\warning You <em><b>must</b></em> install 
\ref install_avr_binutils "avr-binutils",
\ref install_avr_gcc "avr-gcc" and make sure your
\ref path "path is set" properly before installing avr-libc.

\note If you have obtained the latest avr-libc from cvs, you will have to run
the \c reconf script before using either of the build methods described below.

To build and install avr-libc:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c avr-libc-<version>.tar.gz
$ cd avr-libc-<version>
$ ./doconf
$ ./domake
$ cd build
$ make install
\endverbatim

\note The \c doconf script will automatically use the \c $PREFIX environment
variable if you have set and exported it.

Alternatively, you could do this (shown for consistency with \c binutils and
\c gcc):

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c avr-libc-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avr-libc-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\section install_uisp UISP
\addindex installation, uisp

Uisp also uses the \c configure system, so to build and install:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c uisp-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd uisp-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\section install_avrprog Avrdude
\addindex installation, avrprog
\addindex installation, avrdude

\note It has been ported to windows (via cygwin) and linux. Other unix systems
should be trivial to port to.

<tt><b>avrdude</b></tt> is part of the FreeBSD ports system. To install it,
simply do the following:

\verbatim
# cd /usr/ports/devel/avrdude
# make install
\endverbatim

\note Installation into the default location usually requires root
permissions.  However, running the program only requires access
permissions to the appropriate \c ppi(4) device.

Building and installing on other systems should use the \c configure system,
as such:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c avrdude-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avrdude-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\section install_gdb GDB for the AVR target
\addindex Installation, gdb

Gdb also uses the \c configure system, so to build and install:

\verbatim
$ bunzip2 -c gdb-<version>.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ cd gdb-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX --target=avr
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\note If you are planning on using <tt>avr-gdb</tt>, you will probably want to
install either \ref install_simulavr "simulavr" or
\ref install_avarice "avarice" since avr-gdb needs one of these to run as a
a remote target backend.

\section install_simulavr Simulavr
\addindex installation, simulavr

Simulavr also uses the \c configure system, so to build and install:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c simulavr-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd simulavr-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\note You might want to have already installed
\ref install_avr_binutils "avr-binutils",
\ref install_avr_gcc "avr-gcc" and 
\ref install_avr_libc "avr-libc"
if you want to have the test programs built in the simulavr source.

\section install_avarice AVaRice
\addindex installation, avarice

\note These install notes are not applicable to avarice-1.5 or older. You
probably don't want to use anything that old anyways since there have been
many improvements and bug fixes since the 1.5 release.

AVaRice also uses the \c configure system, so to build and install:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c avarice-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avarice-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\note AVaRice uses the bfd library for accessing various binary file formats.
You may need to tell the configure script where to find the lib and headers
for the link to work. This is usually done by invoking the configure script
like this (Replace <tt><hdr_path></tt> with the path to the \c bfd.h file on
your system. Replace <tt><lib_path></tt> with the path to \c libbfd.a on your
system.):

\verbatim
$ CPPFLAGS=-I<hdr_path> LDFLAGS=-L<lib_path> ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
\endverbatim

\note As of 2003-08-15, no offical AVaRice release works like this. Use a
2.0 snapshot until the 2.1 release is made, or use obtain the source from cvs.
