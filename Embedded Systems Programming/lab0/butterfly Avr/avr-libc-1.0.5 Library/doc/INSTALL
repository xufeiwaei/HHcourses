Installation instructions:

1. Build and install the current released version of binutils, version 2.15
   (releases older than 2.13 are not supported), for AVR target
   (configure --target=avr).  See http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/ .

2. Build and install the current released version of GCC, version 3.4.3
   (older releases older than 3.3 are not supported), for AVR target
   (configure --target=avr --enable-languages=c,c++).  C++ support is
   still experimental and incomplete (no libstdc++), and needs testing.

3. Now you can build and install avr-libc -
   type "./doconf && ./domake", then (as root, or user with write
   permissions to the installation directory) "./domake install".
   Note: it is necessary to use a separate build directory for avr-libc
   (building in the source directory does not work correctly) - the
   "doconf" and "domake" scripts do just that.

By default, everything is installed under /usr/local - you can change
that if you execute "PREFIX='what_you_want' ./doconf". There are other
configure options if you like.  Type "./configure --help" to see them.

Note: If you obtained avr-libc directly from cvs, you will need to run the
reconf script. Be sure that you have autoconf-2.13 and automake-1.4 (patch
level >=4 should work but 1.5 or 1.6 will not).
