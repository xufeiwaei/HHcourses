This is avr-libc. It is a C library implementation for use with GNU GCC and GNU binutils for development of programs for Atmel's AVR microcontrollers.

The current branch (1.0), requires the following versions of gcc and binutils:

  Tool            Minimal Version       Preferred Version
  ===========     ===============       =================
  binutils            2.13                   2.14
  gcc                 3.3                 Latest 3.3.x

NOTE: gcc-3.3.3 will not build for avr. This is a known bug, see the gcc bug
database.
