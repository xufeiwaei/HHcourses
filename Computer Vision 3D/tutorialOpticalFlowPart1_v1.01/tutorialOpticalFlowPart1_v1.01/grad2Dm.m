%%%   first, we smooth the new image, replacing the original data:
imNew = conv2(imNew,gg ,'same'); 

%%%now, assume that the previous image was smoothed as well. How do we
%%%estimate derivative in time? Use imNew(the new image) and imPrev (the
%%%previous image) in the most simplest possible way to estimate temporal
%%%derivative
