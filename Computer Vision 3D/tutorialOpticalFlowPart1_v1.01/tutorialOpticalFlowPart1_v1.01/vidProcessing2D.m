function [dx, dy, dt,U1, V1] = vidProcessing2D(movieType, method,bFineScale,spdFactor, lagTime)
% quick usage:
% vidProcessing(); - displays a sequence of test images
% vidProcessing(movieType); - same as above, but on video source indicated by the
% argument. movieType can be:
% 'synthetic' - generates a synthetic video on the fly
% 'camera' - generates video through a connected camera (requires image acquisition toolbox)
% 'cameraX' - where X is number indicating which of system cameras to use
% (default is 1). This is to be input into the string, such as e.g.: 
%         vidProcessing('camera1','edge');
% filename - name of video file in the current folder.
% example: vidProcessing('lipVid.avi'); - assumes an avi file is in the current folder
%
% explicit usage:
% [dx,dy,dt] = vidProcessing(movieType);
% Output dx, dy and dt are all WxH matrices containing the x, y, and t 
% partial derivatives over time. 
% W and H are the height and width of the video
%
% [dx,dy,dt] = vidProcessing(movieType, method); displays the same sequence, but
% with a method selected for analyzing the sequence.
% Valid options for 'method' are:
% - "LK"      (Lukas and Kanade)
% - "NOTHING" ([default] zero fields)
%
% There are 2 special aditional options for 'method', both of which 
% will not give flow output:
% - "gradient"    Displays the gradient values
% - "edge"        Displays the 2D edge detection
% 
% [dx,dy,dt] = vidProcessing('synthetic', method,spdFactor); 
% additionally sets a speed factor (spdFactor) to change the speed of the
% synthetic video generation (if spdFactor=2, then the synthetic sequence 
% is twice as fast)
% final argument "lagTime" is an optional additional lag-time in seconds,
% added as a pause between each frame updates

%ensure access to functions and scripts in the folder "helperFunctions"

%from this point on, we handle the video by the object 'vid'. This is how

% gradient calculations of the subvolume will be handled by the mex module 
% "Grad2D". It has a local copy internally of the previous frame, 
% which we initialize now
